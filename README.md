# TrainingPong

This project will contain recreations of the classic game of Pong using at least 3 different methods. The first is through Unreal Engine 5 (v5.2.1). The second is through Unity (v2022.3.3f1). The third will be through C++ and OpenGL. 
The intent of this project is to become better familiar with how physics systems work in virtual environments. 

A number of files in this project will refer to something called "Pongle". This is a future branch off of this project where I go further in depth and make something more unique. This can already be seen with all of the paddles in this project being aligned verticalls as opposed to horizontally as in traditional Pong.
